<h3>Hello everyone! I'm John.</h3>

I enjoy understanding the world through the lens of data because this can provide reliable perspectives based on evidence. 

I have experience developing computer programs for model estimation and data pipeline. 

Some of my past projects involve handling and analyzing large-scale economic data and microdata. 

My current research interests include understanding the foreign exchange market, the Bitcoin craze and nowcasting. 

I love talking about research and possible collaborations.

And I am excited about the opportunity to be able to learn and grow with everyone.
