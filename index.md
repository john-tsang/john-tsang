### Hello everyone! I'm John.

I am interested in survey sampling and machine learning methods.  

With a computer science background, I have experience developing computer programs for model estimation and forecasting. 

I love talking about research and possible collaborations. And I am excited about the opportunity to be able to learn and grow with everyone.

CV available upon request.
