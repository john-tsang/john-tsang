## Program Packages for Survey Sampling
1. <a href="http://r-survey.r-forge.r-project.org/survey/">Survey</a> [R]
: Summary statistics, two-sample tests, rank tests, generalised linear models, 
  cumulative link models, Cox models, loglinear models, and 
  general maximum pseudolikelihood estimation for multistage stratified, 
  cluster-sampled, unequally weighted survey samples. 
  Variances by Taylor series linearisation or replicate weights. 
  Post-stratification, calibration, and raking. 
  Two-phase subsampling designs. Graphics. PPS sampling without replacement. 
  
2. <a href="https://samplics.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">SAMPLICS: sample analytics</a> [Python]
: In large scale surveys, often complex random mechanisms are used to select samples. 
  Estimations obtained from such samples must reflect the random mechanism to ensure accurate calculations. 
  `samplics` implements a set of sampling techniques for complex survey designs.
