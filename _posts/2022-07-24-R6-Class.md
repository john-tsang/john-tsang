# What is a class system?
`R` is an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">object-oriented programming language</a> with 
four object-oriented class systems.[^1] In other words, there are four ways to write object-oriented programs in `R`: 
(1) S3 (the default in `R`), (2) S4, (3) reference class and (4) R6.

This short note focuses on the R6 class system.

# The R6 Class
Compared with the other three class systems,

* methods[^2] of an R6 object[^3] belong to the object itself and are not generic. Specifically, functions associated with an R6 object exist under the R6 object, while functions associated with an S3 object (say) exist globally.[^4]
  
* R6 objects have public (accessible to others) and private (internal access only) members.

These two characteristics make the R6 class system much more similar to other mainstream programming languages 
such as Python, C++ and Java than the other three class systems.

<a href="https://adv-r.hadley.nz/oo-tradeoffs.html">Chapter 16</a> of Hadley Wickham's book "Advanced R" provides a detailed and technical comparison among the four class systems.

# Is the R6 Class System Used in Practice?
Many recent `R` packages use the `R6` class system, including

* the <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com/">Shiny</a> package to build web applications (e.g., dashboards) for `R`

* the <a href="https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/">dplyr</a> package for manipulating data in data frames.


# Example: Why do Private Members Useful?

To use the R6 class, we need to load and attach the library `R6` first.
```R
library(R6)
```

The following definition of the class `Simulate.Random.Variables` encapsulates input and output for simulating random variables, with all information saved
in an object being public. Therefore, anyone can **update any publicly saved values**.
```R
Simulate.Random.Variables = R6Class(
  classname = "Simulate random variables",
  public  = list(
    random.values = NULL,
    initialize = function(random.function, num.values, ...) {
      self$random.values = random.function(num.values, ...)
    },
    summary = function() {
      cat("Mean:", mean(self$random.values), fill = TRUE)
      cat("Var :", var(self$random.values), fill = TRUE)
    }
  )
)
```

Create an object of the class `Simulate.Random.Variables` to generate 
10 exponential random variables of rate 0.5.
```R
obj = Simulate.Random.Variables$new(rexp, 10, rate = 0.5)
```

Show a summary of simulated random values.
```R
obj$summary()
```

*Output:*
```
Mean: 1.424028
Var : 4.617927
```

Change random values saved in `obj` to a vector of 1's and show the summary.
```R
obj$random.values = c(1,1,1)
obj$summary()
```

*Output:*
```
Mean: 1
Var : 0
```

**Therefore, setting the member `random.values` of `obj` public allows users to hamper saved information and compromises the integrity of the method `summary()`.**

To secure the integrity of method `summary()`, we need to set the member `random.values` private.
```R
Simulate.Random.Variables = R6Class(
  classname = "Simulate random variables",
  private = list(
    random.values = NULL
  ),
  public  = list(
    initialize = function(random.function, num.values, ...) {
      private$random.values = random.function(num.values, ...)
    },
    summary = function() {
      cat("Mean:", mean(private$random.values), fill = TRUE)
      cat("Var :", var(private$random.values), fill = TRUE)
    },
    get.random.values = function() {
      return(private$random.values)
    }
  )
)
```

Create the object again and try to change `random.values` in the object.
```R
obj = Simulate.Random.Variables$new(rexp, 10, rate = 0.5)
obj$random.values = 10
```

*Output:*
```
Error in obj$random.values = 10 : 
  cannot add bindings to a locked environment
```
This time, users cannot update `random.values` in `obj`, so the integrity of `summary()` is preserved.
```R
obj$summary()
```
*Output:*
```
Mean: 1.713084
Var : 2.980672
```

Although users cannot change `random.values` in `obj`, they can access `random.values` through a public method that returns the value of a private member:
```R
obj$get.random.values()
```

*Output:*
```R
 [1] 0.2123883 0.9912447 0.0609936 0.4544109 5.1201417 0.1505100 1.4423703 3.3093614 1.9393995
[10] 3.4500235
```

class system.

# Footnotes

[^1]: A class primarily serves four purposes: (1) polymorphism, (2) encapsulation, (3) inheritance, (4) abstraction. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming">wikipedia page</a> explains these four concepts in detail.
[^2]: Methods are functions associated with a class.
[^3]: An object is an instance of a class.
[^4]: For example, to call a function `summary()` associated with an R6 object `r` and an S3 object `s`, we type `r$summary()` for the R6 object and `summary(s)` for the S3 object.
